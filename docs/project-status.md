# Project Status: Xyndril-lang

This document summarizes which components of the Xyndril-lang project are implemented, which are incomplete, and their current state, based on the actual codebase.

## Implemented Components

- **Tokenizer** (`parser/tokenizer.py`):
  - Fully implemented. Tokenizes code into tokens using regular expressions.
- **Parser** (`parser/parser.py`):
  - Minimal implementation. Calls tokenizer and wraps tokens as a skeleton AST. No full parsing logic yet.
- **AST Definitions** (`src/ast.py`, `docs/ast.cld.py`):
  - Implemented. Defines AST node classes.
- **Interpreter** (`src/interpreter.py`, `docs/interpreter.cld.py`):
  - Implemented. Evaluates AST nodes and supports variable environments.
- **REPL** (`src/repl.py`):
  - Implemented as a basic Python-based REPL for AST node evaluation. Uses a dummy parser for now.
- **Manifest/Specs** (`design/xyndril-manifest.md`, `docs/xyndril-manifest.md`, `docs/language-spec.md`, `docs/parser_spec.md`):
  - Implemented. Contains design, language, and parser specifications.
- **Examples** (`examples/hello.nx`, `docs/examples/`):
  - Present. Contains example Xyndril code.
- **Runtime** (`interpreter/runtime.py`):
  - Present. Interpreter runtime support.
- **Documentation** (`README.md`, `docs/`, `docs_sphinx/`):
  - Extensive documentation and Sphinx setup.

## Incomplete or Placeholder Components

- **REPL (xyndril-kit/src/repl.py)**:
  - Placeholder only. Not implemented.
- **Parser** (full logic):
  - Only skeleton logic exists. No full grammar parsing or AST construction.
- **Server**: Not present.
- **Tests**: No dedicated tests or test/ directory found.
- **Manifest (xyndril-manifest as config file)**: No dedicated manifest config file present, only markdown manifests.
- **Tooling** (`tools/`):
  - Directory exists but is empty.

## Roadmap Comparison / TODOs
- **Lexer/Tokenizer**: Done
- **Parser**: Skeleton only
- **Interpreter**: Done
- **REPL**: Basic version done, full version placeholder
- **Server**: Missing
- **Tests**: Missing
- **Examples**: Present
- **Documentation**: Extensive

## Notable Issues
- Some files (e.g., `src/repl.py`, `xyndril-kit/src/repl.py`) are placeholders or incomplete.
- No automated tests or test suite detected.
- No server or network components implemented.
- Some specifications exist only as markdown, not as code/config.

This status is based strictly on the current project contents. No assumptions are made about missing or planned features beyond what is present in the codebase.
